* DONE Figure out how to enable rerouting packets on the gateways
* DONE Write up how to do it on stack overflow?
* DONE Install strongswan on gateways + try that out
** https://www.strongswan.org/testing/testresults/ikev2/net2net-psk/
* DONE Enable control with environment variables?
* Play with system failures
** DONE Kill the connection
*** Finally managed this with
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.4 -j DROP
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.2 -j DROP
*** Both sides start doing retransmits of a request (with the same message ID, but I think that's a co-incidence)
**** Looks like it's the DPD detection request
*** No logging about the dropped pings
*** Both sides give up after 5 retransmits (around 30-60 seconds I guess?) and then start trying to init a new SA
**** Also fails
*** Now I removed the iptables rule
sudo iptables -D DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.4 -j DROP
sudo iptables -D DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.2 -j DROP
*** on the next retransmit it gets through and the VPN comes back up
*** I found why this takes so long: https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Retransmission
**** the dpdtimeout is ignored for ikev2, instead it uses a global retransmission timeout which uses exponential backoff (and jitter). In total this takes around 165s.
**** We can speed this up by 2x by setting retransmit_timeout=2.0
** DONE Brief connection outage
*** Seems to do what you would hope: it stops sending pings + starts resend DPD requests while it's down.
*** As soon as I turn off the iptables rules everything goes back to normal again.
** DONE One sided connection death
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.4 -j DROP
*** Doesn't seem to stop the pings, which is super weird. Probably an artifact of my testing setup
*** Both sides seem to be detecting the outage though, which is good
*** And everything comes back up afterwards
** DONE Packet loss
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.4 -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50 -j DROP
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.2 -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50 -j DROP
*** ~half of pings make it, ping reports 49% packet loss.
*** DPD packets seem to be getting through within 5 retries, but some have reached attempt 5 so eventualy this is going to fail and it will recreate the connection
**** Yep, within a few minutes I saw this happen. It re-initialised ok though :)
*** Turning it back off again
sudo iptables -D DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.4 -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50 -j DROP
sudo iptables -D DOCKER-USER -d 172.30.0.2 -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50 -j DROP

** DONE Kill/restart a container
docker kill ipsec-playground_moon_1
*** Sun runs DPD, ping starts returning host unreachable
*** When I bring moon back it immediately inits a new connection and everything is fine again
* Play with other configuration
** DONE Incorrect keys
*** Sun initiated
*** Moon logged: tried 1 shared key for '172.30.0.4' - '172.30.0.2', but MAC mismatched
*** Sun logged: received AUTHENTICATION_FAILED notify error
*** Doesn't seem to be auto retrying!
**** Looks like this is intentional: https://wiki.strongswan.org/issues/2098
**** So GCP VPN must be running some other software to automatically retry authentication failures.
** DONE Mismatched subnets
*** Changed sun's subnet to /24 (smaller range)
*** Everything works, and both sides agree to use /24 for that subnet
*** No warning or error messages in the logs, but the CHILD_SA established log message on each side says the subnets that were chosen.
*** Weirdly it seems to have established the connection twice: each side initiated one connection. I guess because of the mismatch it tries it again? No packet loss on the ping though.
** TODO Mismatched key duration times
** TODO Does rekey fuzz cause downtime if the two ends disagree on when to rekey?
** TODO fragmentation/MTU/force encapsulation
** TODO Do we need all of the iptables rules?
** TODO Firewalls etc?
** TODO dpd/closeaction
** TODO compression
* Encode flags correctly
* Real encoding for payloads
* Real payloads for SA_INIT response
* Hopefully strongswan accepts my response?
